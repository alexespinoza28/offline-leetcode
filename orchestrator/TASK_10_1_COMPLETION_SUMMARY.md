# Task 10.1: Performance Profiling and Optimization - COMPLETED

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive performance profiling and optimization system for the Interview Coding Platform.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Performance Profiler (`orchestrator/performance/profiler.py`)

- **Function-level profiling** with execution time, memory usage, and CPU tracking
- **Decorator-based profiling** for easy integration (`@profile`)
- **Thread-safe statistics collection** with detailed metrics
- **System monitoring** capabilities for overall health tracking
- **Performance reporting** with comprehensive analysis

### 2. Execution Monitor (`orchestrator/performance/monitor.py`)

- **Language-specific monitoring** for compilation and execution performance
- **Integration decorators** for existing execution system
- **Performance analytics** by language and operation type
- **Error rate tracking** and success metrics
- **Resource usage monitoring** per execution

### 3. Caching System (`orchestrator/performance/cache.py`)

- **Thread-safe in-memory cache** with TTL support
- **Function result caching** with automatic key generation
- **Cache statistics** and hit rate monitoring
- **Multiple cache instances** for different data types
- **LRU eviction policy** for memory management

### 4. Performance Optimizer (`orchestrator/performance/optimizer.py`)

- **Automated performance analysis** with issue detection
- **Optimization recommendations** based on metrics
- **Automatic optimization application** for safe improvements
- **Performance threshold monitoring** with alerts
- **Historical tracking** of optimization actions

### 5. Enhanced Execution Service (`orchestrator/performance/enhanced_execution.py`)

- **Integrated performance monitoring** in existing execution flow
- **Automatic caching** of execution results
- **Performance metrics** added to API responses
- **Optimization opportunity detection** during execution
- **Comprehensive performance reporting**

### 6. Virtual Environment Setup

- **Kiro configuration** (`.kiro/settings/python.json`) for venv usage
- **Requirements management** (`orchestrator/requirements.txt`) with all dependencies
- **Setup script** (`setup_venv.sh`) for easy environment initialization
- **Environment variables** configuration for optimal performance

### 7. Demo and Testing

- **Simple performance demo** (`orchestrator/simple_performance_demo.py`) working without external deps
- **Comprehensive test suite** (`orchestrator/tests/test_performance.py`) for all components
- **Integration examples** showing how to use the performance system
