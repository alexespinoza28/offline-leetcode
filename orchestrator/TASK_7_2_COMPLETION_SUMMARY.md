## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Community Explanation System Components

#### 1. CommunityExplanationLoader Class (`explain/community_loader.py`)

```python
class CommunityExplanationLoader:
    - explanation.md file detection and loading
    - YAML front matter metadata parsing
    - Priority system with scoring algorithm
    - Automatic metadata extraction from content
    - Caching system for performance
    - Statistics and management utilities
```

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-location Detection**: Searches multiple possible paths for explanation.md files
- **Metadata Parsing**: Supports YAML front matter and automatic content analysis
- **Priority Scoring**: Intelligent scoring based on content quality and completeness
- **Caching System**: Efficient loading and caching with reload capabilities
- **Template Generation**: Creates templates for new community contributions

#### 2. Enhanced ExplanationEngine Integration

```python
class ExplanationEngine:
    - Community explanation priority system
    - Seamless template fallback
    - Code analysis enhancement
    - Source detection and statistics
```

**Integration Features:**

- **Priority System**: Community explanations take precedence over templates
- **Enhancement**: Adds code analysis to community explanations when needed
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to template system
- **Source Tracking**: Identifies explanation source (community/template/fallback)

## üìã Community Explanation Features

### File Detection System

The system searches for `explanation.md` files in multiple locations:

```
problems/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {problem-slug}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ explanation.md                    # Primary location
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ explanations/explanation.md       # Alternative location
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ community/explanation.md          # Community-specific location
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/explanation.md               # Documentation location
```

### Metadata Support

Supports rich metadata through YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
title: Problem Title
author: community-expert
difficulty: easy
tags: [array, hash-table]
created: 2024-01-15
has_code_examples: true
has_complexity_analysis: true
has_step_by_step: true
---
```

### Automatic Content Analysis

When no front matter is present, the system automatically extracts metadata:

- **Code Examples**: Detects code blocks and function definitions
- **Complexity Analysis**: Identifies time/space complexity discussions
- **Step-by-step**: Recognizes structured algorithmic explanations
- **Reading Time**: Estimates based on word count (200 words/minute)
- **Word Count**: Tracks explanation length and detail level

## üéØ Priority System

### Scoring Algorithm

```python
Base Priority: 100 (for all community explanations)

Bonuses:
+ 20 points: Has code examples
+ 15 points: Has complexity analysis
+ 10 points: Has step-by-step explanation
+ 10 points: Long detailed explanation (>500 words)
+ 5 points:  Medium explanation (>200 words)
```

### Priority Hierarchy

1. **Community Explanations** (Priority: 100-165)
   - Comprehensive community explanations score highest
   - Basic community explanations still prioritized over templates
2. **Template-based Explanations** (Priority: 50-80)
   - Pattern-matched templates based on problem characteristics
   - Fallback to default template when no specific match
3. **Fallback Explanations** (Priority: 10-20)
   - Generated when no community explanation or template available
   - Basic code analysis with generic structure

## üîç Content Enhancement System

### Community Explanation Enhancement

When community explanations lack certain elements, the system automatically adds:

#### Code Analysis Integration

```python
# Added when community explanation lacks code examples
## Code Analysis

**Language**: Python
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)
**Data Structures Used**: dictionary, list
**Algorithm Patterns**: Hash Map, Single Pass
```

#### Language-Specific Notes

```python
# Added for language-specific optimizations
## Python Implementation Notes

- Uses Python's built-in data structures for optimal performance
- Leverages list comprehensions and built-in functions where appropriate
- Takes advantage of Python's dynamic typing and flexible syntax
- Follows PEP 8 style guidelines for clean, readable code
```
